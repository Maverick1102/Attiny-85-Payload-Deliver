# Attiny-85-Payload-Deliver

This IC is meant to mimic devices like Rubber Ducky, Bash Bunny but lacks massively in utility. The limited memory space give us very little room to run massive payloads but this roughly demonstrates why we should never just randomly plug in a usb device we find on the ground.
